      <h2>My Story</h2>
      <p>
        Hello! I'm Boniface Mghendi â€” a cybersecurity enthusiast, cloud developer, and tech explorer from the vibrant landscapes of Taita Taveta, Kenya. My journey into technology wasn't sparked by fancy gear or high-speed internet. It was curiosity, a passion to solve problems, and a belief that technology can transform lives that drove me into this space.
      </p>
      <p>
        Growing up in a modest environment taught me the value of resilience, creativity, and learning from first principles. With limited access to tech, I learned to troubleshoot and reverse-engineer devices around me. Eventually, this led me to pursue a diploma in Computer Science at Taita Taveta National Polytechnic, where I could formally explore programming, networking, cloud computing, and cybersecurity.

      <h2>Mindset & Values</h2>
      <p>
        I believe in lifelong learning. Technology evolves daily â€” so must we. I dedicate at least 4 hours a day to learning something new: reading RFCs, solving problems on Hack The Box, or contributing to small security tools on GitHub.
      </p>
      <p>
        My core values are integrity, discipline, curiosity, and humility. I understand that security is not just a technical field â€” it's ethical. This mindset is what drives me to dig deeper when testing systems or developing solutions.
      </p>
      <p>
        I also value open knowledge. Thatâ€™s why I blog, create documentation for my projects, and love teaching peers about API security, Linux file systems, or setting up Docker containers. Helping someone else learn reinforces my own understanding.

      <h2>My Day-to-Day Life</h2>
      <p>
        A typical day in my life starts early. After a morning routine, I dive into studying â€” either coursework for my diploma or a certification track like CCNA or Ethical Hacking. By mid-morning, I switch to practical work: writing code in Java or Python, building Docker containers, or testing vulnerabilities on simulated web apps.
      </p>
      <p>
        I allocate afternoons for projects or freelance work. I enjoy working on things that matter â€” such as automating systems for local organizations, creating security awareness tools, or contributing to cybersecurity blogs. I also mentor junior tech enthusiasts whenever possible.
      </p>
      <p>
        Evenings are for reading, reflection, and strategy. I plan what to build next, analyze security trends, or explore new cloud features. I also watch content from platforms like TryHackMe, NetworkChuck, and PortSwigger Academy to stay current.
      </p>

      <h2>My Passion for Cybersecurity</h2>
      <p>
        Cybersecurity isn't just a buzzword for me â€” it's a personal mission. Iâ€™ve always been fascinated by how things work and, more importantly, how they can be broken. Understanding the layers of digital systems â€” and learning how to secure them â€” gives me a deep sense of purpose.
      </p>
      <p>
        My favorite domains include:
        <ul>
          <li>Network Penetration Testing (Kali Linux, Wireshark, Nmap)</li>
          <li>Web Application Security (OWASP Top 10, IDOR, XSS, Broken Access Control)</li>
          <li>API Hacking (Burp Suite, JWT flaws, mass assignment attacks)</li>
          <li>Cloud Hardening (AWS, GCP, Docker security)</li>
        </ul>
      </p>
      <p>
        My dream is to build tools that make cybersecurity accessible to everyone â€” from small business owners to tech students across Africa.

      <h2>Beyond Technology</h2>
      <p>
        When I'm not on a keyboard, I enjoy giving back to the community. Whether it's through school tech clubs, local IT meetups, or training sessions, I believe in lifting others as I climb. I also enjoy hiking, nature photography, and writing longform articles about life, learning, and leadership.
      </p>
      <p>
        I believe a balanced life â€” mentally, physically, socially â€” makes a better technologist. Thatâ€™s why I take care of my fitness, spend time with family, and engage in offline activities to stay grounded.
      </p>

      <h2>Where Iâ€™m Headed</h2>
      <p>
        My long-term vision is to become a top-tier cybersecurity engineer and architect solutions that help secure Africaâ€™s digital infrastructure. I want to work at the intersection of automation, cloud, and security. I'm also passionate about education, so creating courses, running workshops, and building inclusive developer communities are part of my mission.
      </p>
      <p>
        Whether it's joining a global tech company, founding my own cybersecurity firm, or open-sourcing tools that solve real-world problems â€” Iâ€™m committed to excellence, growth, and making a difference.
