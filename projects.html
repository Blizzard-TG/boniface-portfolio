      <h2>1. <strong>Facemash Clone â€“ Web Voting App</strong></h2>
      <p>
        <strong>Description:</strong> A clone of the original Facemash concept with a twist â€” users vote between two images and the app dynamically updates leaderboard scores using JavaScript logic and localStorage.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Technologies:</strong> HTML, CSS, JavaScript, localStorage, image handling
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Features:</strong> User login, admin image approval, leaderboard, compliments, and upload tracking.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Challenges:</strong> Designing a stateful app with no backend, handling vote logic cleanly, and organizing assets securely in-browser.

      <h2>2. <strong>Dockerized Cyber Lab</strong></h2>
      <p>
        <strong>Description:</strong> Built a self-contained lab environment using Docker to simulate attacks, scan targets, and practice ethical hacking techniques in a safe space.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Technologies:</strong> Docker, NGINX, Node.js, Kali Linux, DVWA
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Challenges Solved:</strong> Created isolated networks, reusable containers, and automated builds for repeatable testing.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Why It Matters:</strong> This project gave me a strong foundation in both DevOps and red-team techniques â€” critical for cybersecurity careers.

      <h2>3. <strong>API Security Testing Toolkit</strong></h2>
      <p>
        <strong>Description:</strong> Created a custom JavaScript toolkit to automate API security checks: testing for IDOR, rate limiting bypass, token manipulation, and parameter tampering.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Tools:</strong> Postman, JavaScript, Burp Suite, Python (for API mocking)
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Problems Solved:</strong> Automates tests that would otherwise take hours manually. Can be used by students and penetration testers for quick assessments.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Impact:</strong> Used in several college demos and shared with peers during workshops.
      </p>

      <h2>4. <strong>Campus Blog CMS (Offline Web System)</strong></h2>
      <p>
        <strong>Description:</strong> Developed a minimal content management system for student blogs that works fully offline using JavaScript, localStorage, and service workers.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Tools:</strong> HTML5, Service Workers, JavaScript, localStorage
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Unique Element:</strong> No server required â€” all posts are stored in-browser, making it ideal for offline or rural settings.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Future Plan:</strong> Expand to Progressive Web App (PWA) with sync-on-connect functionality.
      </p>

      <h2>5. <strong>Wireshark Packet Analysis Report</strong></h2>
      <p>
        <strong>Description:</strong> Completed multiple packet analysis reports to decode protocols, track ARP poisoning attempts, and explain how MITM (Man-In-The-Middle) attacks work.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Tech Stack:</strong> Wireshark, TCP/IP, DNS, ARP, HTTP/HTTPS
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Skills Demonstrated:</strong> Network traffic inspection, signature detection, MAC spoofing analysis, and deep packet decoding.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Purpose:</strong> These reports were used for academic evaluation and personal research purposes.
      </p>

      <h2>Other Noteworthy Projects</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Virtual Machine Setup Automation:</strong> Created Bash scripts to automate Kali Linux installs for lab-ready environments.</li>
        <li><strong>Linux User Management Tool:</strong> Developed a CLI tool in Python to manage Linux users, groups, and permissions efficiently.</li>
        <li><strong>Cloud Notes App:</strong> Built a responsive note-taking app with client-side persistence and dark mode support.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>What I Learned</h2>
      <p>
        These projects helped me bridge the gap between theoretical learning and practical application. Whether itâ€™s simulating attacks, writing frontend interfaces, or managing system-level operations, Iâ€™ve learned the importance of clean code, documentation, and testing.
      </p>
      <p>
        I also gained a deep appreciation for community resources like GitHub, Stack Overflow, and Dev.to â€” where I contribute and learn regularly. Sharing my projects and getting feedback has been crucial for my growth.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Next Steps</h2>
      <p>
        I plan to build more tools aimed at cybersecurity education â€” especially for students in underrepresented regions. I also aim to contribute to open-source security tools, publish writeups from Capture The Flag (CTF) challenges, and build collaborative projects with peers in the African tech community.
      </p>
      <p>
        Eventually, I want to develop a security suite that combines reconnaissance, exploitation, and reporting in a single, user-friendly terminal interface.
